# Finance_market_analysis
Description of the project:
Are there some indications of a bear market in the finance market before it appears? If we knew that, we could be cautious with our money and save some losses. In order to examine that, I would like to check the parameters below:

First, I would like to identify the periods of a bear market vs to the periods right before the bear market
Then, I would like to examine the changes of the p/e ratio right before a bear market occurs.
Next, I would like to examine the changes of the US treasury yield of 2 years and 10 years, and see if anomaly occurs right before bear market appears. Anomaly would be that the yield of 2 years bond is higher than 10 years bond.
Finally I would like to run a regression between the S&P500 price and the quarterly earning change rate of the S%P500 (top 500 companies) and see if there is a correlation between the two parameters. If there is, it might help to see a head a bear market coming...
